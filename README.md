## Mj√ñlnir
A streamlined tool for visualizing any 2D dataset without writing repetitive Python or MATLAB code. Analyze data on the fly, save project in one place, and eliminate cluttered scripts and image files. By reducing workflow complexity, a data can not just seen but better understood.
# What is it made for?
While the purpose of the built is for 2D infrared spectroscopy, this tool adapts seamlessly to any excitation-emission or two-dimensional datasets from fluorescence spectra to electronic spectra. 
# Core Analytical Features
# Smart Peak Detection
Laplacian-based algorithm identifies peaks even in noisy spectra
Adjustable sensitivity for precise localization

# Cross-Section Analysis

Extract and fit slices along both pump and probe axes

Compare multiple slices with overlay plotting

Automatic Baseline Correction

Polynomial or spline-based removal of background artifacts

Visual verification of correction quality

Publication-Ready Output

One-click export in vector formats (PDF/SVG)

Customizable fonts, axis labels, and color scales

Optional gridlines/ticks matching journal guidelines
